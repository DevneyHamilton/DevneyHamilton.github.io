Hey there, I'm Devney (they/she).

I'm a software engineer. For the last 8 years I have been building and launching software with startups, Fortune 500s, non-profits, and movement organizers. Right now I do this with Sassafras Tech Collective, an incredibly smart, scrappy, and supportive team.

My interest in making things people can use right now led me to focus on full-stack web/app development. I have a penchant for building what some people think is impossible, solving complex data problems, and untangling legacy code to make way for the new. So I have an eclectic tool box filled with rapid prototyping, data handling (schemas, APIs, data processing), 3rd party integrations and data syncing, and algorithm work. I expect my focus to shift as technology continues to change.

While I like gnarly problems, when I'm on a team with a goal, I'm most excited for the task that moves us forward. Sometimes that means fixing CSS corner radiuses so the buttons look _good_ and people say 'wow'. Sometimes that means tweaking nginx defaults on the server. Sometimes it's a Python script to prove a concept.

I learn new tools, codebases, and systems quickly and holistically. I make engineering choices based on usersâ€™ real needs and organizational context. I champion my collaborators and dance at small successes. I thrive on teams that prioritize equity for people, and maintainability for software.

I carry with me:
 - strong fundamentals in computer science from doing my MSCS and TA'ing at Stanford.
 - strong fundamentals in software development from Atomic Object
-  an unshakable commitment to real inclusion and the skills to help make it happen on my team, from teaching at Girls Who Code and elsewhere

My software engineering experience includes:
- building three minimum viable products that secured funding and organizational buy-in for novel initiatives
- modernizing legacy software
- adapting legacy software to new uses
- building out several 3rd party integrations with complex data flows
- making background job activity visible and legible to end users

Technologies I have worked with in depth:
- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript: ReactJS, Vue, Angular, Backbone
- CSS, Sass, various CSS libraries
- Swift for iOS
- Postgres, MySQL
- Sidekiq, Redis
- Python for data and graphics
- Git, Linux, Nginx
- once upon a time, PHP

Technologies I've crossed paths with and delivered 1-3 features in:
- OAuth
- Django
- NodeJS
- MongoDB

On a more philosophical note, I think in terms of systems, and see everything as connected. I understand how economic, political, and ideological forces shape what technology gets funded, and how data is likely be used to help or harm. My life experiences give me the (sometimes uncool) view that _people_ solve problems by caring for each other. For tech to 'do good', it needs to create or maintain access, help people spread out resources, and/or allow us shift our attention to caring for one another. I have a responsibility to those who came before and those who will come after to work for healthy communities and ecosystems. Holding that as an engineer has taken me on a the path less traveled by.

Outside of software work, you can find me gardening, dancing, swimming, reading, and gathering with my family, friends, and community.
