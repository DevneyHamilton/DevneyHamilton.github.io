title:  "Delivering Essential Features While Learning On the Job at Bloomboard"

Bloomboard, Inc. is an ed tech company that was in full startup mode when I was there as an intern. CTO Eric Dunn entrusted me with two initiatives: usage tracking and A/B testing, that where mission critical, but not time sensitive. If I had failed, a senior engineer would have redone my work after I left.

In my first summer I learned MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript; learned the codebase; and learned what usage tracking was and ways of building them. At the end of the summer, I launched a usage tracking system with one-line, human readable hooks for engineers to drop in. The next summer I designed and launched an A/B testing system. Both times, I gathered requirements from designers and engineers, came up with technical options meeting both groups' needs, presented them for feedback, and iterated to arrive at the approach I then implemented. Years later Bloomboard was still using these systems, and I used data from usage tracking in a machine learning research project. Bloomboard continues as a company in 2023.
