## Bringing to life TEXERE, a new kind of memorial.
Artist [Indira Allegra][indira-allegra] approached Sassafras with concept designs for [TEXERE][texere], an immersive online experience of weaving. Here, people across time and space would weave grief tapestries together. I scoped the tiniest MVP possible, and wrote up a technical plan that Allegra used to secure starter funding. TEXERE continues to grow with Allegra's leadership and vision. Along the way I have held technical strategy and implementation. Building novel tech with an arts budget has been a beautiful, challenging adventure.

What I did:
- acted as solo engineer on team with a PM+UX designer, in close collaboration with Allegra
- held technical strategy in collaborative efforts that secured initial and expansion funding for a novel software concept
- rapid-prototyped and engineered a consistently visually compelling digital tapestry composition from arbitrary image, text, and sound input
- architected to allow digital tapestries to display in real time on personal devices and on unknown gallery hardware
- communicated technical opportunities, choices, trade-offs, and costs to the client so they could make informed decisions

Results:
- launch at Minnesota Street Project and Ford Foundation led to funding for in-progress expansions in Viverse and more arts exhibition spaces
- Indira Allegra regularly reports back the deeply meaningful experiences people have with TEXERE
