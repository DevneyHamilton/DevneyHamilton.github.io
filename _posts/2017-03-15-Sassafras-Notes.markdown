At [Sassafras Tech Collective][sassafras], I work on a team of highly skilled technologists who are scrappy as hell. We design and build technology for justice and joy, working with NGOs, academics, artists, and beyond. We've built small miracles on tinier budgets, over and over. ([Work with us][sassafras-contact]!)
