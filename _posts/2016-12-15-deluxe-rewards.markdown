## Modernizing Legacy Software
With Jeanette Head's tech leadership and mentorship at Atomic Object, I helped a midsize Midwest company replace their frontend with ReactJS and JSON API. Jeanette's architecture choices balancing real world circumstances with new tools have stayed with me. She set up the client company's staff for success by retaining the backend tools they knew best, and introducing new, more maintainable frontend tools with clear, reusable patterns. I also learned Jest, Gulp, Sass, and Suzy on this project.
