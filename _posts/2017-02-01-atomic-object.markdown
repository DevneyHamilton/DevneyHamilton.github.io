I returned home from Silicon Valley to the Midwest in 2015. [Atomic Object][atomic-object-home] offered the best place to learn high quality, real-world software development. I learned a great deal and benefited from strong technical mentorship and business leadership.  My time there cemented test-driven development, working closely with stakeholders and users, choosing the right tool for the job, and pairing as core to my engineering practice.
