Software engineer. For the last 8 years I have been building and launching software with startups, Fortune 500s, non-profits, and movement organizers. Right now I do this with Sassafras Tech Collective, an incredibly smart, scrappy, and supportive team.

I have so far focused on full-stack web/app development, with an emphasis on backend, data handling (schemas, APIs), 3rd party integrations and data syncing, and algorithm work. I expect that focus to shift as technology continues to change.

But more honestly, I do the task at hand. Sometimes that means fixing the corners on a button so it looks _good_. Sometimes that means tweaking nginx defaults on the server. Sometimes it means Python scripting.

I apply computer science fundamentals to learn new tools, codebases, and systems quickly and holistically. I make engineering choices based on usersâ€™ real needs and organizational context. I champion my collaborators and dance at small successes.

I think in terms of systems, and see everything as connected. I understand how economic, political, and ideological forces make it difficult for me and others to make a living building software that is genuinely useful to our communities. Despite all that, I take seriously my responsibility to those who came before and those who will come after to work for healthy communities and ecosystems. I have dedicated my career to doing that with software, often taking the path less traveled by and working with scrappy teams on under-resourced projects. I thrive on teams that prioritize equity for people, and maintainability for software.

I carry with me:
 - strong fundamentals in computer science from doing my MSCS and TA'ing at Stanford
 - strong fundamentals in software development from Atomic Object
-  pedagogy - and making a coding together a joyous thing - from teaching at Girls Who Code and elsewhere

My software engineering experience includes:
- building three minimum viable products that secured funding and organizational buy-in for novel initiatives
- modernizing legacy software
- adapting legacy software to new uses
- building out several 3rd party integrations with complex data flows

Technologies I have worked with in depth:
- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript: ReactJS, Vue, Angular, Backbone
- CSS, Sass, various CSS libraries
- Swift for iOS
- Postgres, MySQL
- Sidekiq, Redis
- Python for data and graphics
- Git, Linux, Nginx
- once upon a time, PHP

Technologies I've crossed paths with and delivered features in:
- OAuth
- Django
- NodeJS
- MongoDB

Outside of software work, you can find me gardening, swimming, reading, making art, and caring for my family, friends, and community.
