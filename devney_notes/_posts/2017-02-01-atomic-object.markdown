I returned home from Silicon Valley to the Midwest in 2015. [Atomic Object][atomic-object-home] offered the best place to learn high quality, real-world software development. I learned a great deal and benefited from strong technical mentorship and business leadership.  My time there cemented test-driven development, working closely with stakeholders and users, choosing the right tool for the job, and pairing as core to my engineering practice. Here's more on two favorite projects:


## Algorithmic Work with Cutting Edge Tech
I was the more junior member of a dynamic pairing duo tasked with figuring out how a Fortune 500 company could use Bluetooth location sensors to help workers navigate newly open, unassigned office space. **Our work evolved into a software product this company still sells today in 2023.** There was little documentation or writing on the web about these tools at the time, so most of what we learned was through experiments. I geeked out about graph theory and spearheaded the algorithm work, proposing two options we tested together. The algorithm work continued when we needed to incorporate 3rd party calendar data with location data to present relevant information to users. I gained confidence in how I test and prove concepts, and when push comes to shove, put real users' needs ahead of my beloved computer science theory (read more [here][core-location-blog]). I continued learning API design and I learned Rails and Swift development on this project.  


## Modernizing Legacy Software
With Jeanette Head's tech leadership and mentorship, I helped a midsize Midwest company replace their frontend with ReactJS and JSON API. Jeanette's architecture choices balancing real world circumstances with new tools have stayed with me. She set up the client company's staff for success by retaining the backend tools they knew best, and introducing new, more maintainable frontend tools with clear, reusable patterns. I also learned Jest, Gulp, Sass, and Suzy on this project.
